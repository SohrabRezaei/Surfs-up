# SurfsUp_Challenge.ipynb

## Overview of the analysis

We are asked to assess the feasibility of opening up a surf shop by obtaining the temperature data for June and December. This is done by utilizing [SQL ALCHEMY](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/) and creating a SQLite database engine. Finally, I make a query from the temperature data by filtering for the given months.

## Results

* As shown in the images*, The session query for the first deliverable gives us 1700 temperatures with an average of 75 for June with a minimum of 64.
